# Discography Torrent Project - Rules

Last updated: 2026-10-05

This file is the canonical rulebook for the Discography Builder and Duplicate / Edition Analyzer.
When implementation behavior conflicts with this file, this file wins.

## 1. Core objective

Build the most complete practical discography while minimizing unnecessary retained tracks.

Current priority order:

1. Preserve every wanted unique song/recording/version.
2. Keep every album represented.
3. Apply Save Remixes / Save Live at the first classification stage. Unchecked material leaves the analysis pipeline immediately. The sole Save-Remixes exception is a featured performer genuinely added by the remix; a vocalist already present on the normal version of the same song is not a remix exception.
4. Explicit supersedes the corresponding Clean track before fingerprint analysis.
5. Explicitly incompatible stated Version families are unique. A hard semantic skip is allowed only when both sides explicitly state disjoint version families (for example Radio Edit vs Extended Mix). An unlabeled title is not evidence of a base/different version and must remain eligible for acoustic comparison. Exact identical Chromaprint fingerprints always override semantic wording.
6. Prefer CD/physical over equivalent WEB.
7. For CD alternatives, hey-bro-check-log is the rip-quality authority. 80 is the acceptable-score threshold; a better comparable log is preferred for otherwise equivalent CD choices.
8. Minimize total retained track count. Every track physically carried by a retained release counts, including Remix/Live tracks excluded from analysis.
9. Prefer the already processed Existing copy over Recycle/update when every earlier non-DR criterion is tied.
10. DR/mastering is the final unresolved quality tie-break only: measure it only when every non-DR criterion is already equal, then any measurable better score wins.
11. Compilations are below regular Album/EP/Single releases and are retained only for wanted song/version coverage unavailable on regular releases.
12. Duplicate identity is fully automatic: accepted acoustic matches merge automatically regardless of title/artist naming differences; non-accepted matches stay separate automatically. No acoustic manual review.

## 2. Albums and editions

Every album must remain represented, but not every edition of an album must be kept.

When multiple editions of the same album exist:

- choose the edition or combination of releases that preserves all unique material with the fewest duplicated audio files;
- a larger track count does not automatically make an edition preferable;
- unique bonus tracks are a reason to keep an edition only when those tracks cannot be preserved more efficiently elsewhere;
- remixes/live tracks do not automatically make one album edition superior;
- standard/deluxe/limited/special/regional editions must be compared by actual recording coverage.

### Example

Edition A:
- 10 common album tracks
- bonus A
- bonus B

Edition B:
- same 10 common album tracks
- bonus C

If A/B/C exist nowhere else, both editions may need to be kept.

If bonus C also exists on a single, prefer:
- Edition A
- the single containing bonus C

instead of:
- Edition A
- Edition B

because this preserves the same unique material with fewer duplicated album tracks.

## 3. Singles and EPs

Singles/EPs are not automatically kept.

A single/EP can be removed when every recording/version it contains is already preserved elsewhere.

A single/EP should be kept when it contains at least one unique recording/version that would otherwise be lost.

When several singles/EPs overlap:

- prefer the smallest combination of releases that covers all unique recordings;
- if one release is a complete superset of another, the subset release is redundant unless it has a meaningful release-specific reason to keep;
- if a 3-track release contains the unique song plus two songs also issued as separate one-track singles, prefer the 3-track release and remove the redundant one-track singles when the recordings are the same.

## 4. Remixes

- `Save Remixes` is a direct inclusion switch. Checked: remixes participate normally. Unchecked: remixes are skipped completely by release comparison, coverage, counting, optimization, and tie-breaks.
- `Save Live recordings` follows the same rule for live-performance material.
- The only exception to an unchecked `Save Remixes` option is a featured performer genuinely added by that remix. A feature already present on a normal non-remix version of the same song does not rescue the remix.

Before fingerprint comparison, the analyzer may show only unusual/non-standard non-remix/non-live descriptor families that normal rules do not already classify. Examples include `The Matrix Mix`, `Tom Lord-Alge Mix`, and the grouped callout family (`Suggested Call Out Research Hook`, `Suggested Callout Hook`, etc.). Ordinary known patterns such as `Acoustic`, `Instrumental`, `Instrumental Excerpt`, language versions (`German Version`, `Japanese Version`, `Mandarin Version`, etc.), `Radio Edit`, any `Extended Mix` including named forms, `Original Mix`, any `VIP Mix` including named forms, `Clean Edition`, `Single Version`, and similar standard variants must not appear. Remix/live remain controlled only by `Save Remixes` and `Save Live recordings`. Pattern choices affect included coverage only and never duplicate identity.

Rules:

- explicit `Remix`, `Remixes`, `Remixed`, `Rmx`, or `Dub` markers classify remix material;
- a named/credited person, DJ, producer, or act `Mix` also classifies remix material;
- a child variant such as `<Remixer> Radio Edit`, `<Remixer> Edit`, or another named variant inherits Remix status when a sibling of the same base song explicitly establishes that remixer credit;
- the word `Mix` by itself is NOT enough;
- functional/original labels such as `Original Mix`, ordinary `Extended Mix`, `12" Mix`, `7" Mix`, and similar non-credited version labels remain included versions unless remixer context proves otherwise;
- `Club Mix` / `Club Mixes` are remix material;
- `Instrumental` and `A Capella` / `Acapella` are included distinct versions, not remixes;
- a release named `Remixes` does NOT automatically make every track inside it ignored; classify the tracks individually;
- the presence of remix tracks does NOT make the entire release ignored;
- compare the release again after removing only explicitly identified remix tracks from included coverage;
- a mixed release can still be retained when it contains included non-remix material;
- if a redundant release contains explicit remix material, or is itself explicitly titled as a remix package, move the whole redundant release folder under `<artist>_duplicates/!Remixes/`;
- do not delete remix releases permanently; archive them in `!Remixes`.

### Equivalent album-source tie-break

When two editions provide equivalent included non-remix album content:

1. ignore explicitly identified remix tracks;
2. compare the remaining included recording/version coverage;
3. prefer CD / physical media over WEB;
4. prefer the existing processed ALAC copy when source class is otherwise equivalent;
5. only then use duplicated included-track/file count as the tie-break.

A CD edition must not lose to a WEB edition merely because the CD contains extra ignored remix tracks.

Example:

- `Want (Deluxe Edition)` - CD + LOG/CUE, core album tracks plus remix extras
- `WANT` - WEB, same included core album tracks

After remix tracks are ignored, if included coverage is equivalent, keep the CD edition and move the WEB edition to duplicates.

### Analyzer exclusion checkboxes

The analyzer provides two persistent affirmative checkboxes:

- `Save Remixes`
- `Save Live recordings`

Both are unchecked by default. Checked means the category participates normally in release comparison and selection. Unchecked means the category is skipped completely by comparison, coverage, counting, optimization, source/log tie-breaks, and clean/explicit tie-breaks. These options never create duplicate identity; track identity still requires a high-confidence audio match.

## 5. Explicit vs clean - active absolute preference

Explicit > Clean.

If an Explicit counterpart for the same normalized title/version/artist identity exists, the corresponding Clean track is excluded before fingerprint analysis.

- The Clean file does not need to fingerprint-match the Explicit file.
- The Clean track creates no coverage obligation when its Explicit counterpart exists.
- If only Clean exists, keep it normally.
- Explicit/Clean wording itself does not create a separate Version family.

## 6. Unique recording/version definition

Acoustic fingerprinting is the duplicate authority for tracks that are eligible to be compared.

- External database recording identifiers are not read or used by the analyzer.
- Reported duration is routing/diagnostic only and never proves or disproves recording identity.
- Candidate discovery is a bounded routing stage, not an identity rule: same-base-title and exact-fingerprint safety routes bypass duration; different-title fingerprint candidates use normalized/IDF-weighted token evidence and bounded duration neighborhoods.
- Very common fingerprint tokens are down-weighted and are not allowed to create near-all-pairs candidate explosions.
- A deterministic shadow-validation sample of rejected candidates must be acoustically checked; any sampled false negative is recovered and logged.
- Every automatic duplicate merge must pass the acoustic matcher.
- Alignment may compensate for leading/trailing silence or padding.
- Substantial unmatched non-silent content means a distinct recording/version.
- Semantic wording is a candidate-routing safety gate, not stronger identity evidence than exact audio.
- If only one side states a Version label, compare acoustically: the unlabeled side may simply omit the same version wording.
- If both sides share any stated family/context, compare acoustically.
- Only two explicitly stated, disjoint Version families may be hard-skipped before full audio comparison (for example Radio Edit vs Extended Mix).
- Exact identical Chromaprint fingerprints are always the same recording regardless of conflicting Version text.
- Examples of Version families include Radio Edit/Version, Extended Mix/Version, Acoustic, Instrumental, A Cappella, language versions and comparable explicit version descriptors.

Automatic acoustic decision policy:
- accepted acoustic match -> merge automatically, even when titles or artist credits differ;
- non-accepted / near-threshold match -> keep separate automatically;
- no acoustic identity decision is delegated to the user.

## 7. Source preference

For equivalent wanted content:

1. CD/physical beats WEB.
2. For CD alternatives, hey-bro-check-log is the rip-quality authority.
3. Comparable score 80 is the acceptable threshold.
4. A below-80 CD choice loses to a compliant at/above-80 alternative when both preserve the required coverage.
5. Between otherwise equivalent CD rips, prefer the better comparable log.
6. No external rip-database confidence is used.

CD detection:
- CUE + real rip LOG is CD evidence;
- a real EAC/XLD rip LOG can also establish a track-based CD rip without CUE;
- audiochecker.log alone does not make a release CD;
- explicit medium metadata may also establish CD.

Source preference never removes a unique wanted recording/version.

## Existing discography precedence

Existing is a late tie-break, not a hard quality floor.

For otherwise interchangeable choices:
- source class decides first;
- CD-log quality decides next where applicable;
- lower total retained track count decides before Existing precedence;
- the already processed Existing copy wins an otherwise complete non-DR tie;
- DR/mastering is measured only if Existing/Recycle status and every other non-DR criterion are also tied;
- DR therefore never causes a Recycle copy to replace an otherwise-equivalent Existing copy merely because its measured dynamics are higher.

### Optional existing-discography mode

The Existing discography folder is optional.

- If Existing is provided, compare Existing + Recycle together using all normal source/preference rules.
- If Existing is blank, analyze and optimize Recycle against itself only.
- Recycle-only mode must still remove redundant editions/singles/remix-only releases according to the same rules.
- An empty Existing path is valid and must not trigger a folder-selection error.
- The saved Existing path can be cleared and must remain cleared across launches until the user selects one again.

## 8. Existing discography vs recycle/update

Existing and Recycle are analyzed together when Existing is supplied.

- Existing is not presumed optimal.
- Recycle may add unique material, replace inferior equivalent material, or become redundant.
- Release/container names never prove duplicate identity.
- Included coverage is based on confirmed acoustic recording groups.
- Existing preference is applied after source, CD-log quality and total-track-count rules tie, and before DR/mastering.
- DR/mastering is only consulted when the alternatives are still exactly tied after Existing/Recycle preference and every other non-DR rule.
- Multi-disc folders belonging to one release remain one logical release.
- Remix-only/Live-only releases eliminated at step 1 never participate in later comparison or optimization; they remain only for final Apply bookkeeping.

## 9. Optimization model

Hard requirements:
- every active wanted recording/version is covered;
- every active album family remains represented;
- ignored releases cannot provide coverage;
- ignored tracks and step-1 excluded Remix/Live/Clean material create no coverage obligation;
- compilations may provide only wanted groups unavailable on regular releases.

Quality/provider floor:
- do not drop below required source class;
- CD-log acceptability is part of provider quality;
- Existing status is not a hard floor.

Global cost order after requirements/quality are satisfied:
1. avoid selected CD releases with comparable rip-log score below 80 when compliant alternatives exist;
2. minimize total retained track count, counting every track carried by every retained release;
3. minimize retained release count;
4. minimize Recycle/update release count, so Existing wins an otherwise complete tie;
5. stable release-ID ordering.

CUE image layout receives no special one-file optimization bonus. Compare image and track-based CD rips by normal source/log/content rules and total logical track count.

After the exact solve, a better exact-equivalent CD rip log may replace the selected carrier. DR/mastering is then measured only for exact final ties that remain equal on every non-DR criterion.

## 10. Decision states

Final filesystem-plan states:
- KEEP
- REDUNDANT
- REPLACE
- NEW

There is no acoustic REVIEW state.

Duplicate identity is automatic:
- accepted acoustic evidence merges the pair;
- anything below automatic acceptance remains separate;
- different naming never turns an accepted acoustic match into a user choice.

Every REDUNDANT/REPLACE result must explain which retained release/track covers it.

## 11. Confidence

Automatic duplicate identity requires high-confidence acoustic evidence.

- same-title eligible tracks can merge only after passing active acoustic thresholds;
- alignment may compensate for silence/padding;
- substantial unmatched non-silent content blocks a merge;
- only two explicitly stated, disjoint Version families may be filtered before expensive cross-version matching; unlabeled-vs-labeled pairs remain eligible, and exact identical Chromaprint always overrides wording;
- different-title strong matches merge automatically when the acoustic matcher accepts them;
- narrow near-threshold non-matches remain separate automatically;
- everything outside automatic acceptance remains separate without asking the user.

External database recording identifiers are not part of this analyzer.

## 12. Title normalization for comparison

Comparison may use normalized titles, but normalization must never erase version meaning.

Use the shared Picard rules in:
`picard-tools/scripts/`

Relevant rules include:

- English_Title_Capitalization
- Move_Featured_Artists_to_Title
- Format_Multiple_Artists
- Unicode_to_ASCII

Normalization can standardize spelling/case/punctuation/featured-artist placement.

It must preserve semantic qualifiers such as:
`Remix`, `Live`, `Acoustic`, `Radio Edit`, `Extended`, `Instrumental`, `A Capella`, `Dub`, etc.

## 13. Album example: Queen of Time

Given:

- `2018 - Queen of Time (Limited Edition) [EU - NB 4126-0]`
  - common album tracks
  - unique bonus `As Mountains Crumble`
  - unique bonus `Brother and Sister`

- `2018 - Queen of Time [JP - GQCS-90570]`
  - same common album tracks
  - unique bonus `Honeyflow (ft. Akira Takasaki)`

If `Honeyflow` exists nowhere else, both editions may be required.

If the same `Honeyflow` exists on a single, prefer keeping:
- the Limited Edition album
- the single containing `Honeyflow`

and remove the Japanese album edition, because the album remains represented and all unique songs remain covered with fewer retained tracks.


### Release container and move integrity\n\n- Release folders may be nested under organizational folders such as `Albums`, `Other`, `Singles`, or per-title grouping folders. Discovery must recurse through those containers and identify the actual release folders. Multi-disc subfolders such as `CD1`, `CD 2`, `Disc 1`, etc. belong to one parent release and must not be treated as separate releases.

- Each direct child folder of the selected artist/recycle root is one release container.
- Audio may be stored recursively inside that release container, including `CD1`, `CD2`, `Disc 1`, etc.; those disc subfolders are not separate releases.
- Automatic filtering moves the complete top-level release container, never only an internal disc subfolder.
- A planned move may never be silently skipped.
- Every move must be verified: source gone, destination present.
- If any move fails, report the exact source/target and roll back moves already completed in that run.

## 14. Automatic filtering / safety

The analyzer must do the filtering itself. It must not require the user to inspect release rows or make line-by-line duplicate decisions.

Normal flow:

1. Scan both folders.
2. Compare tracks automatically.
3. Optimize the retained release set automatically.
4. Show one global confirmation with only summary counts.
5. Move redundant release folders automatically.
6. Leave required recycle releases in place for the next workflow stage.
7. Show only a short completion summary.

Safety rules:

- Do not permanently delete release folders.
- Move redundant folders as-is; never rename release folders while archiving them.
- The archive folder is named `<original recycle artist folder>_duplicates`, e.g. `3OH!3_duplicates`.
- Create `<artist>_duplicates` as a sibling of the selected artist folder. Example: `...\!recycle\3OH!3` -> `...\!recycle\3OH!3_duplicates`.
- Redundant releases containing remix material go under `<artist>_duplicates/!Remixes/`.
- Non-remix redundant releases go directly under `<artist>_duplicates/`.
- Reuse the same duplicates folder across runs; do not create timestamped archive folder names.
- Provide Undo for the last run.
- A single global confirmation before moving folders is sufficient; do not require per-release approval.
- If equivalence is uncertain, retain the material automatically.
- If an archive destination already exists, abort instead of renaming or overwriting folders.
- If folder structure makes an automatic move unsafe, abort the apply operation without changing anything.

## 15. Current 3OH!3-specific test case

The historical 3OH!3 dataset remains a regression dataset, but current v0.22.2 rules apply:

- preserve unique wanted non-remix songs/versions;
- remove unchecked Remix/Live material at step 1;
- Explicit supersedes corresponding Clean before fingerprinting;
- keep all albums represented;
- CD/WEB, CD-log threshold/quality, total retained track count, then Existing precedence apply before any DR/mastering tie-break;
- acoustic duplicate identity requires zero manual input: accepted matches merge automatically; all others remain separate.

## Persistent user data

This project follows the general software persistence rule:

- Any repeatable user-supplied data should be saved and reused automatically across launches and versions.
- This includes credentials/tokens, paths and folders, last-used locations, selected options, preferences, and other recurring inputs.
- Use one common application-data location under the user's dynamically resolved Windows Documents library so redirected/moved Documents folders are handled correctly.
- Updates must reuse the same stored data rather than making the user enter it again.
- Sensitive values such as credentials/tokens must be protected appropriately, e.g. Windows DPAPI.
- Ordinary non-sensitive settings such as folder paths can be stored as normal settings data.
- For Duplicate / Edition Analyzer specifically, remember at minimum:
  - Existing discography (ALAC)
  - Recycle / update folder


## English capitalization and label naming

These are the canonical English capitalization rules for album titles, track titles, artist/band names, and label names.

### Title capitalization

Use standard mixed case.

Capitalize:
- nouns;
- verbs, including `be`, `been`, `am`, `are`, `is`, `was`, `were`;
- adverbs;
- subordinating conjunctions;
- adjectives;
- pronouns;
- the first and last word of every title or major title segment.

Normally lowercase internal:
- articles: `a`, `an`, `the`;
- coordinating conjunctions: `and`, `but`, `or`, `nor`, `for`, `yet`, `so`;
- short prepositions: `as`, `at`, `by`, `for`, `in`, `of`, `on`, `to`, `from`;
- `versus`, `vs.`, `v.`;
- `etc.` when meaning "and so on/and so forth";
- `to` when forming an infinitive.

Grammar exceptions:
- capitalize `but` when it functions as an adverb ("Life Is But a Dream");
- capitalize `so` when adjectival ("You Are So Beautiful");
- capitalize `as` when functioning as a subordinating conjunction;
- capitalize a preposition when it is part of a phrasal verb ("Get Out of This Country").

Major punctuation starts a new title segment. After a colon, question mark, exclamation mark, dash used as a major separator, parentheses, or quotes, capitalize the first and last word of the segment.

For hyphenated compounds, capitalize each component according to the same title rules.

Only preserve all-caps where common usage is genuinely acronym/abbreviation capitalization. All-uppercase/all-lowercase artwork styling alone is not an artistic-capitalization exception.

Contractions and slang follow the same rules. Keep forms such as internal `o'` ("Will o' the Wisp") and `'n'` ("Rock 'n' Roll") lowercase where they stand for lowercase words.

Proper nouns keep their proper capitalization.

### Artistic-intent exceptions

Preserve genuinely intentional nonstandard capitalization used by the artist/release, e.g. `k.d. lang`, `Yellow mY skYcaptain`, or intentional lowercase `tourette's`.

Do not infer artistic intent merely because cover art prints an entire artist/title/tracklist in uppercase or lowercase.

The Picard capitalization script must not blindly title-case artist names. Artist/album-artist capitalization should come from the authoritative metadata/current artist name unless an explicit normalization rule says otherwise.

### Picard implementation

Source of truth:
- `picard-tools/scripts/English_Title_Capitalization.txt`

The script applies the deterministic title rules to both track `title` and `album`, including:
- articles/conjunctions/prepositions;
- first/last-word behavior;
- major punctuation divisions;
- common phrasal-verb exceptions;
- `vs.` / `v.` / `etc.`;
- slang forms such as `o'` and `'n'`.

Grammar-dependent and artistic-intent exceptions remain governed by this rulebook if a simple Picard script cannot infer them perfectly.

### Record label capitalization

Preferred forms:

- A&M Records
- Atlantic
- Arista Records
- ATO Records
- Below Par Records (or Below Par where source usage supports it)
- Brightside
- Casablanca Music
- Central Station Records
- Dance Pool
- Data Records
- Decaydance Records
- Decca
- DGC
- Dreamworks
- Eleven: A Music Company
- EMI
- EPIC
- Griffen Records
- Hussle Recordings
- Interscope Records
- Jive Records
- Lava Records
- Mercury Records
- Nettwerk
- Octone Records
- Rhino Records
- Radioactive Records
- Roadrunner Records
- Shock Records
- Sony
- Universal
- Virgin Records
- Wah Wah Music
- Walt Disney Records
- Warner
- WEA
- Wind Up
- Zoomba Recordings

Specific preferred forms:
- `EPIC`, not `Epic` or `EPIC recordings`;
- `Roadrunner Records`, not `roadrunner records pty. ltd.`;
- `Sony`, not `Sony Music`;
- `Universal`, not `Universal Music`;
- `Warner`, not `Warner Music`;
- `WEA`, not `Warner Elektra Atlantic`;
- `Wind Up`, not `Wind Up Records`.

Where a label officially ends in `Records`, keep `Records` except for the explicit preferred-form exceptions above.

Multiple-label formatting is not fully standardized yet; keep the source labels rather than inventing a destructive normalization.

## CD rip log quality hierarchy - implemented

Duplicate Edition Analyzer uses `ligh7s/hey-bro-check-log` v1.3.2 (Apache-2.0) as an automatically managed runtime dependency for supported EAC/XLD rip logs.

Rules:
- ignore `audiochecker.log` for rip-quality scoring;
- rip-log score is never duplicate evidence;
- compare log quality only after two CD releases are proven exact-equivalent in release/content/source structure;
- require all relevant rip logs for a release to be recognized before assigning a comparable quality key;
- unsupported or unrecognized logs remain neutral;
- multi-disc comparison uses worst-disc score first, then average score, then flagged status;
- a higher-scoring exact-equivalent CD rip may replace an Existing lower-scoring rip;
- when log quality ties or is unavailable, Existing-copy precedence remains;
- Explicit/Clean remains the absolute final tie-break after CD rip-log quality.

Do not rank CD rips by filenames or guessed ripper text; parse and score the actual log contents.

- `Original Mix` is an original-version label and must NOT be classified as a remix merely because it contains the word `Mix`.

### Album-edition clustering

Alternate album editions are grouped primarily from audio-derived included-track overlap and track order, not edition/folder names. Strong ordered overlap between fingerprint groups identifies related editions even when labels such as Limited, Special Bonus, Sketch Book, regional names, or other edition wording differ.

### Duplicate archive structure

Redundant folders must preserve their source-relative hierarchy under `<artist>_duplicates`. Example: `Singles/Title/Edition` moves to `<artist>_duplicates/Singles/Title/Edition`. Remix-bucket moves preserve the same hierarchy under `<artist>_duplicates/!Remixes/`.

Do not flatten release folders into the duplicate root. After successful moves, remove organizational directories that became empty.

- After the main optimizer, run a final selected-set redundancy prune. A non-album release that contributes no included audio beyond other retained releases must be removed when equal-or-better source copies remain. Album releases may be pruned only when another retained release still represents the same audio-derived album cluster.

- When the unusual-pattern classifier changes materially, stale review choices from older classifier generations must not be reused; start the new classifier generation with clean defaults while preserving new choices thereafter.

### Structural standard-pattern recognition

- The unusual-pattern review must classify ordinary version families structurally rather than by exact full-label whitelist. Artist/remixer/source prefixes do not make a standard family unusual (for example `BT Radio Edit`, `Adam Beyer Instrumental`, `Dan's Bedroom Demo`, `Deezer Session`, `Junkie XL Vocal Mix`, or `Eric Kupper 12\" Mix`).
- Named/ambiguous plain `Mix` labels remain review candidates when they do not match a known standard family, e.g. `The Matrix Mix` and `Tom Lord-Alge Mix`.
- Normalize common mojibake in displayed/tag-derived pattern text before classification.

### Named `Mix` remix rule

- A `Mix` credited/named after a person, DJ, producer, or act is remix material even when the literal word `Remix` is absent. Examples: `Ferry Corsten Mix`, `Tom Lord-Alge Mix`, `Madlib's Mix`, `Timo Maas Mix`.
- Ordinary functional/style labels such as `Original Mix`, `Extended Mix`, `VIP Mix`, `Radio Mix`, `Vocal Mix`, `Instrumental Mix`, `12\" Mix`, etc. remain normal version labels unless another remix rule applies.
- Named-person `Mix` tracks are controlled by `Save Remixes` and must not appear in the unusual-pattern review.

### Pattern-review refinement

- Standard suffix/type recognition must work regardless of any artist/remixer/source prefix.
- Year-only fragments extracted from compound labels are not review patterns.
- Bare `hook` belongs to the same review family as Suggested Call Out / Callout Hook.
- `Mix by <name>` and handle-style credited mixes such as `only4Erol Mix` are remix material and follow `Save Remixes`.
- UI examples should repair common UTF-8/Windows mojibake before display.

### Remaining standard-form normalization

- Treat Big Mix, New Mix, Smooth Mix, Low Gain Mix, OG Version, Chillout/genre Version, Special DJ Version, regional code Version labels (US/UK/etc.), and 7-inch/12-inch Version forms as ordinary patterns.
- Slash compounds consisting only of ordinary components, such as `Single Version / 2008`, must produce no unusual-pattern entry.
- A style/genre suffix such as `Pop Version` remains ordinary even when preceded by an artist/act credit.

### Intra-release duplicate-file rule

- Retained releases may contain redundant audio files. Clean them conservatively only when duplicate identity is already proven by the high-confidence audio group after the metadata safety gate and the files also represent the same logical track position/title within the same physical disc/folder.
- The title/track-position check is a safety gate only; it must never create duplicate identity by itself.
- Prefer the technically better survivor (lossless over lossy, then sample rate/bit depth/channels, then deterministic codec/container preference). Move redundant files to `!Duplicate Files`; never delete them.
- Do not automatically remove files from CUE-based releases because exact filenames can be referenced by the CUE sheet.
- Treat `Rmx` as a remix alias equivalent to `Remix` for Save Remixes handling and `!Remixes` routing.

### ITUNESADVISORY clean/explicit rule

- `ITUNESADVISORY=0` means clean; `ITUNESADVISORY=1` means explicit.
- Advisory state must not create or block duplicate identity and must not affect normal coverage, source selection, or track-count minimization.
- Apply advisory preference only as the absolute final release-selection tie-break.
- A clean release may be replaced by an explicit release only when they are otherwise exact equivalents: same release identity after advisory wording is stripped, same release type, same source class, same total/included track count, same included track order, and the same audio-group multiset.
- When that exact-equivalence test passes, retain explicit and move clean.
- If clean and explicit audio differs, preserve both as distinct material.

### Intra-release dedupe tag-fallback rule

- Fingerprint all audio files even when they are excluded from included coverage; exclusions affect optimization, not the ability to prove duplicate files inside a retained release.
- For intra-release cleanup, duplicate identity still requires the same high-confidence audio group.
- Same-track safety requires the same physical folder and compatible track position, but title agreement may come from either the embedded title or normalized filename. A bad TITLE tag must not block cleanup when the filename and audio identity agree.

### CD rip log quality rule

- Use `ligh7s/hey-bro-check-log` (Apache-2.0) to score supported EAC/XLD rip logs; ignore `audiochecker.log` for this purpose.
- Rip-log score is never duplicate evidence and must never merge recordings/releases by itself.
- Apply log quality only between otherwise exact-equivalent CD rips: same release identity/type/source class, same total/included track count, same included audio-group order, and the same included audio-group multiset.
- Require all non-AudioChecker rip logs belonging to a release to be recognized before that release receives a comparable log-quality key. Unsupported/unrecognized logs are neutral, not automatically bad.
- For multi-disc releases compare worst-disc score first, then average score; unflagged wins an otherwise equal tie.
- A higher log score may replace an already-processed existing CD rip when the rips are exact equivalents. If log quality ties or is unavailable, existing-copy precedence remains.
- Clean/explicit preference remains the absolute final tie-break after CD-rip log quality.

### Absolute Save Remixes / Save Live rule

- When `Save Remixes` is unchecked, every remix is completely invisible to release selection and track counting except a remix that genuinely adds a featured performer not already credited on a normal version of the same song.
- When `Save Live recordings` is unchecked, live-performance material is completely invisible to release selection and track counting. Treat explicit `Live`, `Session`/`Sessions`, and `Unplugged` labels as live-performance material.
- Excluded tracks must not affect included track count, release-type heuristics, edition/superset comparison, minimum-track optimization, source/existing tie-breaks, CD-rip-log exact-equivalence checks, or clean/explicit exact-equivalence checks.
- Excluded tracks may remain physically in a retained mixed release; they simply cannot help or hurt that release during selection.

### Direct checkbox inclusion rule

- Use direct include/skip checkbox semantics only.
- `Save Remixes` checked: remixes participate normally in all release-selection logic. Unchecked: remixes are skipped completely.
- `Save Live recordings` checked: live recordings participate normally in all release-selection logic. Unchecked: live recordings are skipped completely.
- A skipped track contributes nothing to release coverage, counts, edition comparison, optimization, CD-log quality comparison, existing-vs-recycle precedence, or clean/explicit tie-breaks.
- Skipped tracks may physically remain inside a mixed release that is retained for other included tracks.

### Exact global minimum-track rule

- Preserve all active wanted groups and album obligations first.
- Preserve source class and CD-log quality requirements.
- Minimize total retained track count, counting excluded extras carried inside kept releases.
- Then minimize retained release count.
- Then minimize Recycle/update release count; Existing therefore wins only a complete later tie.
- CUE image layout receives no special physical-file discount.
- Re-Analyze after Ignore/Restore reuses existing fingerprints/groups.

### Tempo/effect remix rule

- Treat `Sped Up` / `Speed Up`, `Slowed` / `Slowed Down`, and `Reverb` / `Reverbed` variants as remix material.
- These variants follow `Save Remixes` exactly: checked means they participate normally; unchecked means they are skipped completely.
- Redundant releases/packages identified by these labels route under `!Remixes` just like explicit remix releases.

### Personal Picks rule

- Personal Picks are the single persistent home for explicit user keep choices created by phrase/title rules and by **Unusual track pattern review**.
- Phrase/exact-title Personal Picks do not override an unchecked `Save Remixes` or `Save Live recordings` switch.
- An unusual track pattern explicitly checked in **Unusual track pattern review** is kept for that run and immediately added to Personal Picks as a persistent Pattern rule.
- New unusual patterns start unchecked unless they already exist in Personal Picks. Existing Pattern Personal Picks appear checked/locked in the review and are removed persistently only from **Personal Picks**.
- Unchecked unusual patterns are skipped for the current run and are not stored as separate negative preferences. The legacy hidden `unusual_pattern_preferences_v5` map is obsolete; positive legacy choices migrate into Personal Picks.
- The only exception to early remix elimination is a featured performer genuinely added by the remix. An ordinary song vocalist repeated in remix metadata is not an exception.
- Personal Picks never create duplicate identity. Duplicate identity remains acoustic-fingerprint based.
- Phrase rules match normalized track title/filename text case- and punctuation-insensitively; exact-title rules require normalized full-title equality. Pattern rules match the analyzer's canonical unusual-pattern key.

### Personal Picks phrase detector rule

- Personal Picks must provide a `Detect phrases...` action that scans the currently selected Existing and New/update folders for live/remix phrases in audio filenames.
- Detect parenthetical/bracket descriptors and named/trailing Mix descriptors; only show phrases classified as live or remix material.
- Normalize punctuation/year suffixes and group recurring `Live From` / `Live At` venue phrases so equivalent year/location formatting does not create needless separate rules.
- Show counts/examples and let the user add multiple detected phrases as persistent phrase rules.
- Detection is only a convenience for creating preference rules; it never affects duplicate identity by itself.

### Automatic Personal Picks review rule

- The Live/remix phrase review is shown only when `Save Remixes` is enabled.
- It surfaces only unusual/ambiguous phrase families; ordinary Remix/Mix/Dub forms remain hidden.
- Existing Personal Picks are marked as already selected.
- Personal Picks do not resurrect categories disabled by the global Save switches.
- The review never creates duplicate identity.

### Per-program persistent-data rule

- Every program must own its own folder under the dynamically resolved Windows Documents library: `Documents\\Karpuzikov Tools\\<Program Name>\\`.
- Duplicate Edition Analyzer uses `Documents\\Karpuzikov Tools\\Duplicate Edition Analyzer\\`.
- Keep `settings.json`, dependencies, logs, temporary working files, caches, comparison data, undo/state data, and every other analyzer-owned persistent/working file inside that program folder.
- Use the standard subfolders `dependencies`, `logs`, `temp`, `cache`, and `state` when those categories exist.
- Do not place analyzer-owned files directly in the shared `Documents\\Karpuzikov Tools` root.
- Preserve and migrate older shared-root/LocalAppData state automatically where practical instead of making the user recreate it.
- System-wide dependencies installed by Windows/WinGet may remain in their normal system locations; any dependency files downloaded and owned by this program must live under its own `dependencies` folder.

### Unusual-pattern artist-title separator rule

- Never treat an ordinary `Artist - Title` or `Artist: Title` separator as a version/pattern boundary just because the title happens to contain words such as `Club`, `Live`, `Edit`, or `Mix` internally.
- A trailing separator segment may enter unusual-pattern review only when that segment itself has a clear descriptor shape, normally ending in `Mix`, `Remix`, `Version`, `Edit`, `Live`, `Session`, `Acoustic`, `Instrumental`, `Dub`, `Redux`, etc.
- Clear song titles with no actual ETI/version descriptor must not appear in Unusual track pattern review.

### CD image rip rule

- Support lossless CD rips stored as one audio image plus CUE, including FLAC, APE, WavPack and WAV images.
- Detect image mode only when multiple `TRACK ... AUDIO` entries in a CUE reference the same physical audio file. A normal split-file CUE must remain a split-file release.
- Fingerprint the actual CUE audio segment, not the whole image file, so image rips can match split-track rips track-by-track.
- Temporary extracted segments are working files only and must be deleted after fingerprinting; they are never part of the collection.
- The physical CD image, CUE, LOG and companion files remain one indivisible release for move/rollback purposes. Never move or delete individual tracks from a CUE image.
- CD image tracks participate in the same Save Remixes, Save Live recordings, Personal Picks, collection-wide minimum-track, source-preference, and CD-quality rules as ordinary tracks.



### Mandatory software-development rule

- Apply the user's newest stored software-development standards as a required preflight before every software/program/script change. They are requirements, not optional defaults.
- Newer explicit rules override older conflicting rules.
- GUI software is dark-theme by default unless explicitly overridden.
- Prefer one complete double-clickable `.pyw` file and the minimum practical file count.
- Bootstrap/check WinGet before dependency setup. Install missing dependencies automatically and check installed dependencies for updates without requiring manual setup.
- App-managed dependencies must use the program's own `dependencies` folder.
- Keep update behavior and documentation framed as an in-place update for existing installations.
- New/unfinished GitHub software uses the status label `Under construction ⚠️`.
- Preserve existing settings and migrate legacy storage when paths/layouts change.
- Prefer immutable version/commit-pinned external download sources over mutable branch archives.
- Update implementation and documentation together in the same version.
- Cache-busting rules apply to web/userscript delivery; they are not applicable to this native `.pyw` tool.
- Credential rules are not currently applicable because Duplicate Edition Analyzer stores no authentication secrets.

### Decision explanation rule

- Every analyzed release must have a user-visible explanation of why it is retained or marked duplicate.
- The explanation must be available visually in the application; the user must not be required to inspect a text/JSONL comparison log.
- Show the Decision Map before proposed filesystem moves are applied so the user can inspect the reasoning first.
- The Decision Map must support every release in the run, including KEEP, ADD, REPLACE, SKIP, REMOVE, conservative fallback, and excluded-only outcomes.
- For retained releases, show the direct reason and, when applicable, unique/essential recording versions, required album representation, Personal Picks, source/rip-quality context, and releases it replaces.
- For duplicate releases, show which retained releases cover its included fingerprint groups, how many groups each covers, representative track titles, and any preferred-existing relationship.
- Show remix/live/pattern exclusions separately so skipped material is visibly distinguished from duplicate audio coverage.
- Same-coverage/related-release metadata is explanatory context only; it must never be presented as the evidence that created duplicate identity. Duplicate identity remains audio-based.
- Persist the latest compact Decision Map snapshot as program state under the analyzer's own `state` folder so it can be reopened without enabling detailed comparison logging.
- During the live post-analysis Decision Map, every release must expose the other releases that share its included audio groups, and those release nodes must be directly navigable.
- A retained release may be manually excluded from the current plan. This is a reversible planning constraint only until Apply; it must not move/delete files immediately.
- Manual exclusion must re-run only collection optimization against the already-computed fingerprint groups. Do not rescan folders, re-probe files, regenerate Chromaprint fingerprints, or repeat pairwise audio comparison.
- Re-optimization must apply the same album/source/existing/minimum-track rules to the remaining eligible releases and automatically select alternate carriers where available.
- The selected release must expose its full track list. If a manually excluded release contains an included recording group with no non-blocked carrier anywhere else in the analyzed collection, highlight that track clearly in red as unique/unavailable elsewhere.
- Applying a plan that would lose such manually orphaned included audio requires an explicit second confirmation that identifies the affected recordings. Never hide or silently accept this loss.
- Manual exclusions may be undone before Apply. Saved Decision Map snapshots may be reopened read-only when the in-memory analysis objects are no longer available.
- The visual graph is release-only. Do not place Factor, Reason, Track, or other non-release nodes in the network. Detailed reasoning belongs in the selected-release details panel and is collapsed by default.
- Do not pair a permanent side list with the graph. Navigation is by release nodes plus a compact search/jump control.
- The release details area must contain a large high-contrast track table and use a draggable pane/sash so the user can increase or decrease track-list height.
- The selected release path must be selectable/copyable and have an Open folder action.
- The Release Map must be a normal resizable/maximizable top-level window without transient/modal grab behavior so Windows window managers such as FancyZones can position it.
- A live Release Map must expose obvious Apply plan, Analyze again, and Close actions. Do not show disabled/confusing text such as "Re-optimization available only immediately after Analyze"; when editing context is unavailable, simply omit edit controls and present the saved map read-only.
- Optimizer/source factors are secondary detail and must be hidden behind an expandable More details control by default.

### Persistent manual track skip

- In the live Release Map the user may select a track and choose Skip track. This is a preference to exclude that proven recording group from coverage/optimization, not a duplicate-identity assertion.
- Save track-skip preferences under the Duplicate Edition Analyzer program state folder, never in the shared Karpuzikov Tools root.
- Skipping a track must immediately re-run only collection optimization; do not rescan/re-probe/re-fingerprint audio.
- The user must be able to Restore track, which removes the saved preference and recomputes the plan.
- Manual track skips must remain visibly distinct from Save Remixes / Save Live / unusual-pattern exclusions.



### Release Map UI architecture

- The Release Map must show **all analyzed releases at the same time in one graph**. Never replace the full graph with a selected-release subgraph, neighborhood-only view, drill-down graph, or any other sub-map.
- The graph contains release nodes only. Selecting a release may highlight/dim relationships, but must not remove other release nodes from the map.
- **Duplicate releases appear on the Release Map only as secondary duplicate rows connected to the retained release(s) that cover them.** They must be visually distinct from retained releases and must never be mistaken for retained output.
- **Remix-only releases must not appear on the graph when Save Remixes is unchecked.** A release whose only relevant/included material is excluded by the remix setting is omitted from the graph.
- **Live-only releases must not appear on the graph when Save Live recordings is unchecked.** A release whose only relevant/included material is excluded by the live setting is omitted from the graph.
- These are visibility rules for the graph, not deletion rules. Hidden duplicate/remix/live releases remain part of the analyzed result/state where needed for re-optimization, explanations, undo, and future setting changes.
- A release that contains at least one currently included non-remix/non-live recording may still appear even if some of its tracks are excluded by Remix/Live settings. The node represents the release's currently included material only.

- No nested navigation: no release list + map pairing, no menus within menus, no sub-maps, and no multi-level drill-down navigation. A release click opens one direct details surface for that release while the full graph remains visible.
- The Release Map UI must no longer use Tkinter/ttk. Use a modern GPU/web-rendered UI stack suitable for a large interactive graph and normal Windows window management.
- Preferred architecture: **PySide6 / Qt 6** as the Windows desktop shell with **Qt WebEngine** rendering a custom HTML/CSS/SVG release board. Python remains the analyzer/backend and communicates with the UI through a direct Qt bridge. A force-directed node library is not required for the chronological board.
- The Release Map must support smooth scrolling, search-to-release, click selection, connected-line highlighting, and track-carrier highlighting while all currently relevant release rows remain loaded in the same board.
- Selecting a release must not navigate away from the graph. Show release/track details in a single flat side or bottom panel; closing/changing selection returns focus to the same full graph state.

### Release Map interaction workflow

- Release nodes must be rendered as compact **rectangular release cards**, not circles/bubbles. The release name is the primary visible content of the card.
- The red/yellow/green unique-track indicator is a **small badge attached to the release card**, never the entire release node.
- Release-card text must be high-contrast light text on a dark card. Black/dark text on the dark graph background is prohibited.
- Relationship edges between releases must remain visibly distinguishable on the dark background at the default fitted view. Use clear mid/high-contrast lines; selecting a release strengthens its connected edges while unrelated edges may dim but must not disappear completely.
- Layout spacing must account for card dimensions so release cards do not collapse into an unreadable pile at the default view.
- Every visible retained release node shows a **unique-track count badge** based on the current plan:
  - **1-2 unique tracks:** red badge.
  - **3-5 unique tracks:** yellow badge.
  - **6+ unique tracks:** green badge.
  - A retained release with zero unique tracks shows **no unique-track badge**. Never render a `0` bubble. If such a release survives for another explicit rule, explain the reason in details without inventing a numeric badge.
- Clicking a release does not navigate away from the full graph. Its details panel unfolds in place while **all visible releases remain on the same map**.
- The details panel must show the full currently relevant track list. Tracks that are unique to the selected retained release are visually highlighted.
- Hovering a track exposes a compact **Ignore** action for that track. Do not permanently show Ignore buttons on every row.
- In a live editable map, the release-level **Ignore release** action must be a prominent high-contrast destructive button at the top of the selected release details panel. It must not be hidden inside secondary details or a nested menu.
- Track-row **Ignore** must become clearly visible on hover with destructive/high-contrast styling. It may be hidden when not hovering, but it must not be obscured by the status text.
- Closing and reopening the Release Map after analysis must preserve the live editable analysis context until Apply or a new Analyze starts. Reopening must not silently downgrade to a read-only snapshot and remove Ignore/Re-Analyze/Apply actions.

- Clicking **Ignore** on a track excludes only that exact physical track instance from optimization and adds only that instance to the persistent track-ignore list. It must never expand through acoustic group ID, fingerprint equality, base title, or another release carrying the same recording. The current graph does **not** silently mutate into a final state yet; instead, the global **Re-Analyze** button becomes visually highlighted/enabled to show there are unapplied analysis changes.
- Track Ignore means: only the clicked physical file/CUE track stops contributing coverage, uniqueness, or release-retention value during the next re-analysis. Other copies of the same recording and other tracks in the same release continue to follow normal rules.
- Clicking **Ignore** on a release is a separate operation from track Ignore. It excludes **only that exact release** as a source candidate for the next optimization pass. It does **not** ignore or blacklist the recordings inside that release; those recordings remain eligible to be supplied by any other release according to normal matching/selection rules.
- Any pending track-ignore or release-ignore change highlights/enables **Re-Analyze**. Re-Analyze must use the already-computed scan/probe/fingerprint/comparison data whenever possible and re-run the collection-selection logic with the new ignore constraints; do not unnecessarily rescan or re-fingerprint unchanged audio.
- Re-Analyze must reconsider releases that were previously classified as duplicate/hidden, because they may become necessary replacement sources after a track or release is ignored.
- After Re-Analyze, unfold one bottom **result drawer** showing the exact cause/effect delta from the previous plan. Keep the full release graph visible above it.
- Result-drawer wording must be concrete, for example:
  - `IF track: "Hot (Riffs & Rays Radio Edit)" ignored, THEN release: "2008 - Hot - Single [GB - none]" removed`.
  - `IF release: "2014-10-23 - Лучшие Хиты [191018022853]" ignored, THEN releases: "2013-12-05 - In Your Eyes [5948204031992]", "2014-04-15 - Cola Song (feat. J Balvin) [075679940926]" added`.
- The result drawer must list all release additions/removals caused by the pending ignore change, not only the first one.
- After a successful Re-Analyze that changes the plan, **Apply** becomes visually highlighted/enabled.
- **Apply** is the only action that commits the current proposed filesystem move plan. Ignore and Re-Analyze are planning operations only.
- If Re-Analyze produces no plan change, say so explicitly in the result drawer and do not falsely highlight Apply as if there were new filesystem actions.
- The graph after Re-Analyze still follows graph visibility rules: duplicate/redundant releases, remix-only releases when remixes are disabled, and live-only releases when live is disabled stay hidden unless they become retained/otherwise visible under the new plan.
- Unique-track badges, unique-track highlighting, release details, and result-drawer deltas must all refresh from the same newly computed plan so the UI never shows stale pre-analysis values.

### Chronological folder-board layout and connection semantics

- The Release Map is a chronological **folder-style release board**, not a force-directed bubble/circle graph.
- Sort all visible release rows by the date prefix in the release folder name (`YYYY-MM-DD`, then `YYYY-MM`, then `YYYY`; undated rows last). Preserve ascending chronological order across columns.
- Lay releases out in compact vertical columns resembling Windows Explorer folder rows. The release folder name is the primary text; do not use oversized cards or circular nodes.
- Retained releases use normal high-contrast rows. Duplicate/redundant releases use visually secondary rows marked `DUP`.
- The small red/yellow/green unique-track badge remains only on retained rows. Duplicate rows use a neutral duplicate marker instead.
- Default connection lines have exactly one meaning: **duplicate release -> retained release(s) that cover its included recording groups**. Do not draw generic connections merely because two retained releases share some audio.
- Duplicate connection lines must be clearly visible but visually secondary. Selecting a release strengthens only the duplicate relationships touching that release.
- Clicking a track in release details activates **track-carrier mode**. Every visible release containing that exact recording group is highlighted, all other release rows dim, and bright connection lines run from the selected release to every other visible carrier.
- Track-carrier mode includes duplicate releases, so the user can immediately see previously rejected/duplicate releases that contain the same recording.
- The UI must state how many visible releases contain the selected track and provide one direct `Clear track highlight` action.
- Clicking another release clears track-carrier mode unless the user selects a track again. The full chronological board remains present at all times; there is never a sub-map.

### Personal Picks phrase extraction and review

- Personal Picks phrase detection must extract the version/remixer descriptor, not the base song title. For `Club Rocker (Play & Win Remix)`, the reusable candidate is `Play & Win Remix`; the full title must not also appear as a phrase candidate.
- The same applies to `Gimme Gimme (Ness Remix)` and `Gimme, Gimme (Dirty Nano Remix)`: use the bracketed remix descriptor only.
- A full-title fallback is permitted only when the input is genuinely a descriptor string rather than a complete track title.
- Personal Picks Review must provide direct clipboard access: each detected candidate has a Copy action and the review has Copy all review text. The persistent Personal Picks list must support Ctrl+C for selected rows and a Copy all action.


### Permanent track-family taxonomy

This taxonomy is a standing rule for all future Duplicate Edition Analyzer work. These categories are mutually distinct and must never be collapsed into one generic "version" family.

- **Version** means an alternate studio/release edit of the same underlying recording family, such as: Radio Edit, Radio Version, Extended Mix, Extended Version, Single Edit, Single Version, Main Version, Original/Main Mix, Album Version, Album Edit, or comparable non-remix/non-live edit/version wording.
- **Remix** is a separate category. Remixes are **not Versions**, even when they are edits/extended forms of a remix. Examples include Producer/DJ Remix, Club Remix, Dub Remix, Remix Edit, Remix Radio Edit, Remix Extended, VIP Remix, **Chillout Mix**, and similar remix-family titles. `Chillout Mix` must always be classified as Remix, never Version.
- **Live recording** is a separate category. Live recordings are **not Versions**, even when the title literally contains the word `Version`, for example `Live Version`. Concert/live/stage recordings belong to the Live category, not Versions.
- Classification must follow semantic meaning, not the literal presence of words such as `Version`, `Edit`, or `Mix`.
- **Parent-family precedence:** when an edit/version suffix describes a remix-family recording, the track remains a **Remix**. For example, `Gimme Gimme (Sebastien Radio Edit)` is a Remix: `Radio Edit` describes the radio-length edit of the Sebastien remix; it does not turn that remix into a Version. The same rule applies to `<Remixer> Radio Edit`, `<Remixer> Extended Mix`, `<Remixer> Radio Version`, `<Remixer> Extended Version`, and equivalent remix-edit wording.
- Release Map alternative-family UI, connection logic, counts, and Gem calculations must respect these categories independently. Remixes and Live recordings must never increase the `Versions N` count.
- For 💎 Gem logic, "has another Version" means another **Version-category** recording only. A Remix or Live recording of the same base song does not disqualify an otherwise unique track from 💎.


### Initial vs Result plan counters

- Release Map must always show **Initial** and **Result** counters side-by-side for both retained releases and counted tracks.
- **Initial** is captured from the first completed Analyze plan and stays unchanged for the entire live analysis session, including repeated Ignore/Re-Analyze cycles and closing/reopening that live map.
- **Result** represents the latest completed Analyze/Re-Analyze plan and shows signed cumulative differences from Initial for both releases and tracks.
- When Ignore changes are pending but Re-Analyze has not run, do not predict counts. Keep the last computed Result and visibly mark it as pending Re-Analyze.
- A brand-new Analyze resets Initial and starts a new comparison baseline.
- Track count means tracks currently participating in coverage inside retained releases; tracks skipped by active options or the manual ignore list are not included in this counter.
- The Re-Analyze result drawer must repeat the cumulative Initial -> Result release/track totals so the impact remains visible alongside the concrete release additions/removals.
- The main window must provide a compact folder control immediately beside Logging that opens this program's isolated `Documents\\Karpuzikov Tools\\Duplicate Edition Analyzer\\logs` directory.


### Main UI technology

- The active Duplicate Edition Analyzer main window uses the same PySide6 + Qt WebEngine + HTML/CSS/JavaScript UI stack as Release Map.
- Keep the main window and Release Map visually unified: same dark palette, Segoe UI hierarchy, compact controls, border/radius language, status/progress treatment, and interaction density.
- Do not revert the active main window to Tkinter in future updates unless the user explicitly requests it.
- Keep long-running work off the WebEngine/UI thread; progress and activity must remain live through the Qt bridge.

### Ignored-release inspect and restore workflow

- A release ignored from Release Map must **never disappear from the map** merely because it is ignored. Keep it in its chronological position and visibly mark it `IGNORED BY YOU`.
- Before Re-Analyze, show explicit `PENDING IGNORE` / `PENDING RESTORE` states. Do not pretend replacement sourcing has already changed.
- After Re-Analyze, keep the ignored release selected/open when possible so the user can immediately inspect the consequence of the decision.
- Every included track in an ignored release must state where that exact recording is retained instead. Show a deterministic primary retained source and, when applicable, the number of additional retained copies.
- If an ignored release contains an included exact recording that no retained release supplies, show a prominent red `NO REPLACEMENT` warning for that track. Do not silently substitute an alternate Version, Remix, or Live recording.
- Re-Analyze result details must repeat the track-by-track replacement sourcing for ignored releases, not only the release-level added/removed list.
- An ignored release must always expose an obvious `Restore release` control. Restoring changes the planning constraint and requires Re-Analyze; it does not require a new full audio scan.
- Ignore/Restore/Re-Analyze remain planning operations. No files are moved until Apply.


## Dynamic-range/mastering-quality rule - current

Dynamic range is mastering-quality preference only, never duplicate evidence.

- Measure integrated LUFS, LRA, true peak, RMS/crest-style contrast and a derived dynamics score with bundled FFmpeg.
- Cache measurements.
- Do not measure DR merely because releases look like duplicate candidates.
- First finish coverage, source, CD-log quality, total-track-count/release-count, Existing/Recycle, Explicit/Clean and every other non-DR decision.
- Measure DR only for exact interchangeable releases that remain unresolved after all of those rules tie.
- Any measurable higher dynamics score wins inside that final tie; there is no material-difference threshold.
- If DR also ties, use the stable deterministic fallback.
- DR never causes different stated Versions to merge.

## Planned Live / remix phrase review cleanup - v0.21.0

The phrase-review stage exists only to surface unusual or ambiguous descriptor families that the normal classifier does not already understand.

Rules:

- do not show ordinary remix/mix families in the review;
- standard credited forms such as `<name> Remix`, `<name> Mix`, `<name> Vocal Mix`, `<name> Club Mix`, `<name> Radio Mix`, `<name> Extended Mix`, and other normal producer/remixer-named mix variants are auto-classified and hidden;
- a phrase being frequent does not make it review-worthy;
- a phrase being a Personal Pick does not make it review-worthy;
- existing Personal Picks remain active without forcing their ordinary phrase family into the review;
- only genuinely unusual/unknown/ambiguous phrases should be displayed;
- normal Remix/Live classification is controlled by `Save Remixes` and `Save Live recordings`; Personal Picks do not override disabled categories;
- this review must never create duplicate identity.

Examples that must no longer appear:
- Hybrid Mix
- Armin van Buuren Remix
- BT Remix
- Libra Mix
- Maor Levi Remix
- Mark Norman Remix
- Sean Tyas Remix
- Sultan & Ned Shepard Remix
- Junkie XL Vocal Mix
- Adam K & Soha Remix
- Cedric Gervais Remix
- Digital Stories Remix
- Dylan Rhymes Push Up Mix
- Ferry Corsten Mix
- Funkagenda Mix
- Josh Gabriel Remix
- Sander Kleinenberg's Convertible Mix
- ALPHA 9 Remix
- Andy Duguid Remix
- Brothers In Rhythm Mix

The intended review contents are only patterns that cannot already be confidently categorized by the normal Remix/Live/version classifier.


## UI filesystem-path rule - planned for v0.21.0

Any local filesystem path shown in the Duplicate Edition Analyzer UI must have a folder/open-location icon immediately before it.

Behavior:

- directory path -> open that directory in Windows Explorer;
- file path -> open Explorer with that file selected when possible;
- the icon belongs directly before the path it controls;
- apply the rule everywhere a path is visible, including main UI, Release Map, review screens, diagnostics, errors, logs, planned actions/results, dependency/status views, and future UI;
- do not require copying the path or navigating manually;
- if the target no longer exists, fail gracefully and keep the displayed path unchanged.

This is a global DEA UI rule, not a one-screen exception.


## Live / remix phrase review behavior - v0.21.0

The Live / remix phrase review is an exception-review UI, not a catalog of normal remix names.

- Do not show this stage unless Save Remixes is checked.
- Standard remix/mix phrases must not appear in the review.
- Examples that should be suppressed include:
  - <artist> Remix;
  - <artist> Mix;
  - Hybrid Mix;
  - other conventional Remix / Mix suffixes that are already confidently classified by the normal remix detector.
- Show only unusual, ambiguous, or otherwise unrecognized live/remix phrases where a human preservation choice is useful.
- Existing Personal Picks remain checked when the stage is shown.
- The phrase-review stage must not change duplicate identity; it only controls preservation/exclusion policy for remix/live families.


## Fingerprint comparison execution - v0.21.0

- Candidate identity rules and acoustic thresholds are unchanged.
- Expensive full fingerprint comparisons run in small bounded process batches instead of giant ordered chunks.
- Identical fingerprint vectors are accepted directly as definitive acoustic identity.
- Once two tracks are already in the same validated acoustic Union-Find component, another candidate comparison between them is skipped because it cannot alter the final grouping.
- These execution shortcuts must not weaken the existing metadata safety gate or introduce metadata-based duplicate identity.
- Progress must update continuously and expose comparisons/sec and ETA for long runs.


## Early remix/live elimination rule

When `Save Remixes` is OFF, tracks classified as remixes are eliminated at the first classification stage, **except when the remix genuinely adds a featured performer not already present on a normal non-remix version of the same song**. Repeating the song's ordinary vocalist in title/filename/ARTIST metadata does not preserve the remix.

When `Save Live recordings` is OFF, tracks classified as live recordings are eliminated at the first classification stage.

Eliminated remix/live tracks must not participate in any later analytical stage. In particular they must not be:

- fingerprinted;
- added to fingerprint-token indexes;
- acoustically compared;
- placed into recording groups;
- used for dynamic-range/mastering analysis;
- used for coverage calculations;
- used by the global optimizer;
- used for release-quality tie-breaks;
- used to influence keep/remove decisions for wanted audio.

The analyzer keeps only the filesystem/release bookkeeping needed so those excluded files or releases can be moved at the final Apply stage.

If the corresponding Save option is ON, those tracks remain in the normal analysis pipeline.

Featured-remix exception:
- applies only when the remix introduces at least one featured performer absent from the normal non-remix version of that same song/primary artist;
- such tracks are not early-discarded when `Save Remixes` is OFF;
- a featured vocalist already present on the normal song does not qualify;
- if no normal counterpart exists, artist-tag or filename-prefix feat./ft./featuring is not enough to preserve the remix; only a feature explicitly attached to the remix/version wording itself is an exception;
- they are fingerprinted, compared, grouped, coverage-counted, dynamically analyzed when otherwise eligible, and optimized like normal wanted audio;
- the exception does not apply to ordinary remixer naming such as `Artist Remix` or `Artist Mix`.


### v0.21.1 implementation note

- Early Remix/Live elimination is implemented in the executable pipeline.
- Eliminated tracks are not fingerprinted, indexed, acoustically compared, grouped, dynamically analyzed, or optimized.
- A remix with `feat.`/`ft.`/`featuring` is an exception only when the performer is proven new relative to a normal version of the same song/primary artist, or when the feature is explicitly attached to the remix/version wording itself. Artist-credit prefixes alone never prove a remix-added feature.
- A featured remix that is also Live still obeys `Save Live recordings`.
- Detailed comparison logs record eligible-track count, early-eliminated count, and featured-remix exception count.


## v0.22.0 authoritative corrections

This section supersedes older historical wording elsewhere in this file.

- External database recording IDs are not read or used.
- No external rip-database confidence/verifier is used.
- Version = unique song/version, but unlabeled metadata is not proof of a different/base version. Only explicitly incompatible disjoint Version families are hard-skipped; exact identical Chromaprint always wins over wording.
- Different-title accepted acoustic matches merge automatically; near-threshold non-matches remain separate automatically. No acoustic manual review.
- Explicit > Clean before fingerprinting.
- Compilations are lower than regular Album/EP/Single and survive only for wanted groups unavailable on regular releases.
- CD rip log threshold is 80, with hey-bro-check-log as the authority.
- Optimize total retained track count, not physical file count; CUE images receive no one-file discount.
- DR has no material threshold: when earlier rules tie, any measurable better DR score wins.
- Existing is only the later tie when source/log/track-count/DR all tie.

## v0.22.1 zero-manual-input acoustic identity

This section supersedes every older manual-acoustic-review rule.

- The analyzer must never ask the user whether two tracks are the same recording.
- If the acoustic matcher accepts a pair, the pair is the same recording automatically.
- Different title spelling, alternate title, typo, artist-credit difference, featured-credit difference, or release context must not downgrade an accepted acoustic match to REVIEW.
- If the acoustic matcher does not accept a pair, keep both recordings separate automatically.
- Near-threshold/ambiguous non-matches are preserved, not reviewed.
- Only strong, explicitly incompatible semantic families may pre-block comparison. Weak/named Edit/Mix wording such as `BT Edit`, `Album Edit`, `Single Mix`, or `American Radio Edit` must remain acoustically comparable unless another strong family conflict exists.
- The goal is zero manual duplicate-identity input while remaining conservative when audio evidence is insufficient.

Regression case:
- `Voigt Kampff Test - BT & Nick Phoenix` vs `Voigt Kamff Test - BT`;
- score about 0.1152, overlap 100%, good 100%, definitive acoustic identity true;
- required result: automatic MATCH and no user prompt.


## v0.22.2 candidate-routing, DR and logging corrections

This section supersedes older candidate-routing, DR-order and detailed-log wording.

- Expensive acoustic comparison must no longer approach all-pairs behavior merely because common Chromaprint tokens collide.
- Same-base-title pairs and identical fingerprint vectors remain safety routes and are acoustically resolved regardless of reported duration.
- Different-title candidates are routed with bounded duration neighborhoods plus normalized fingerprint-token containment; duration remains routing-only and never becomes identity evidence.
- Token evidence is weighted by rarity. Very common tokens are suppressed from far-distance candidate expansion.
- High-confidence candidates are processed before weak candidates so validated Union-Find components can eliminate redundant later work transitively.
- A deterministic shadow-validation sample is run against router rejects. A sampled acoustic false negative is recovered into the recording group and explicitly logged.
- Semantic Version detection includes named `... Mode` descriptors such as `Lunar Mode` and explicit release-level families such as `Extended Versions`.
- Common mojibake and harmless unmatched tag-edge quotation garbage are normalized before semantic routing; normalization must not strip legitimate leading/trailing apostrophes.
- Wanted tracks whose fingerprint generation fails remain conservative singleton recording groups; a fingerprint failure must never erase wanted coverage.
- Comparison logging uses normalized per-track catalog records plus compact pair references. Full pair details are kept for matches, content-gate cases, near-threshold cases, shadow recoveries and a deterministic reject sample; ordinary rejects are aggregated into funnel/route/duration counters.
- DR/mastering runs only after the normal optimizer and all non-DR preference passes. Only exact interchangeable releases that remain fully tied are measured.
- Existing/Recycle status is part of the pre-DR tie signature. DR cannot override Existing with an otherwise-equivalent Recycle copy.
- Re-Analyze uses the same final-tie-only DR rule without rescanning/re-fingerprinting unchanged audio.


## v0.22.4 semantic-version false-unique correction

This section supersedes every older rule that treated one labeled side and one unlabeled side as automatically different recordings.

- An unlabeled title does not mean "base/original version". It means the version is unspecified.
- Therefore pairs such as `Four (Original Mix)` vs `Four`, `Tomahawk (Original Mix Edit)` vs `Tomahawk`, `Always (Radio Edit)` vs `Always`, and equivalent cases must reach acoustic comparison when candidate evidence permits.
- Same-base-title routing remains a safety route for these pairs.
- Exact identical Chromaprint fingerprints bypass semantic-version conflict completely and merge automatically.
- If both sides explicitly state version families, a hard semantic skip is allowed only when their declared families are disjoint. Shared family/release context means audio gets the final say.
- Explicitly incompatible examples such as `Radio Edit` vs `Extended Mix` remain safely separated before expensive comparison unless their fingerprints are literally identical.


## v0.22.5 remix exclusion and weak-version-gate correction

This section supersedes older featured-remix, contextual-remix, and generic Edit/Mix conflict wording.

- The featured-remix exception is about a performer added by the remix, not the song's ordinary featured vocalist repeated in remix metadata.
- Determine ordinary featured performers from non-remix/non-live versions of the same base song and primary artist across the analyzed collection.
- If a remix carries only those ordinary feature credits, it is excluded when Save Remixes is OFF.
- If the remix adds a new explicit featured performer, it remains the sole Save-Remixes exception.
- If no normal counterpart exists, a feature in the artist credit or filename artist prefix is not preserved automatically; only remix-specific feature wording can create the exception.
- Parent-family Remix inheritance is release-title independent and collection-wide, scoped by base song + primary artist. Explicit remixer evidence on one release can classify the same remixer's child edit/version on another release.
- Examples that must classify as Remix when remixer evidence exists anywhere in the analyzed collection include `Mood II Swing Radio Edit`, `Mantronik Electrohippy Formula`, `Dave Aude Radio Edit`, `Loverush UK! Radio Edit`, `Lucid Mix Edit`, and comparable named child variants.
- A confident non-primary two-word possessive remixer descriptor such as `Simon Hale's Orchestrata` is Remix even without a literal Mix/Remix word.
- Weak labels such as `BT Edit`, `Album Edit`, `Single Mix`, and generic/named edits are not strong enough to veto acoustic comparison.
- Regression pairs that must reach the acoustic matcher include `Godspeed (Radio Edit)` vs `Godspeed (BT Edit)`, `Remember (American Radio Edit)` vs `Remember (Album Edit)`, and `Remember (Edit)` vs `Remember (Single Mix)`.
- Strong structural conflicts such as Radio vs Extended or Acoustic vs Instrumental remain eligible for semantic pre-blocking unless exact identical Chromaprint overrides the wording.


## v0.22.6 Release Map track-ignore and responsiveness correction

- Track-level `Ignore` / `Restore` is exact-instance only. It must affect only the clicked physical file or virtual CUE track.
- Acoustic-group identity, identical fingerprint, same base title, and same recording on another release must never cause a second track row to inherit the click.
- Legacy pre-v0.22.6 broad manual-skip rules based on fingerprint groups/base titles are not reapplied because their original physical target cannot be recovered safely.
- Ignore/Restore clicks update the visible row and dirty/Re-Analyze state immediately without rebuilding the complete Release Map or rerunning optimization.
- Expensive plan/map reconstruction happens on explicit `Re-Analyze`, not on every click.
- Full track titles in Release Map details wrap to multiple lines instead of permanent ellipsis truncation; the complete title is also available as a native hover tooltip.
